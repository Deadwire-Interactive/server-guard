# server-guard
Welcome to Server Guard on GitHub! This repository is designed for users to submit issue reports that contain bugs found in our application, view upcoming or recent updates, and read our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy!

## Reporting bugs
When reporting a bug, please ensure it is not on the "do-not-report" list.
You can find that list [here](do-not-report.md).

Report bugs by creating a new issue [here](https://github.com/Deadwire-Interactive/server-guard/issues).

__When creating a report, please follow the template that is auto-filled when you create an issue__

**If the bug is a vulnerability, or major enough to the point of abuse, please contact support immediately in our [Community server](https://discord.gg/E6ep3rb7cQ)**

Do **NOT** share major vulnerabilities/bugs with ANYONE; this can lead to your account being blocked from using our application.

We take these bugs seriously, and we aim to get most bugs squashed within one to two business days after being reported.

## Rewards?
We do not typically offer any type of rewards for reporting bugs, but we occasionally will. This is a case-by-case basis.
